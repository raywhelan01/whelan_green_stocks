# whelan_green_stocks
My assignment submission for module 2

### Challenge

This VBA script builds on the work done from the module to create a tool that can analyze the total volume and annual return of any number of stocks, given that they are first sorted alphabetically and then chronologically.

The script does a first pass through to count the number of unique stock tickers, then initializes  four arrays (ticker symbol, total volume, start price, and end price) of that count's length to store the required data for each stock. Using a ticker index, the script then loops through the data set only once to collect the data for every stock in the arrays. Finally, the data is written into the analysis tab and appropriately formatted.
